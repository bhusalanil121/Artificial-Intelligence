    "   From the above result, We can analyze that numpy.sum method is the fasted method among four to calculate the sum. Second, and third fastest method are Math.fsum and Naive summation method respectively. Compensated summation method is the slowest method as a time analysis, but it is the most accurate method to calculate sum. Comparing the results for absolute and relative errors, Naive Summation method has the highest error and numpy.sum method is the the second highest. Since, we took Math.fsum method as the exact result, it will not have any error.    \n",
